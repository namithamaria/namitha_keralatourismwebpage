       <h2>Idukki</h2>
       <p>
        Idukki is Kerala's second largest district and has been blessed with numerous natural wonders. The high valleys and hill ranges of this landlocked region are fed by three major rivers - Periyar, Thalayar and Thodupuzhayar and their tributaries. Its forest still hosts many tribes and over half of the terrain is still covered with forests. People love going to the gigantic arch dam for getting its mesmerising view. Blessed with a wide range of trekking trail, each of them offers a spectacular view of the valley below and ranges above of Idukki. The place is also renowned for its exotic flora and fauna and one can come across many rare species while visiting Idukki.
